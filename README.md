# Estrogen_3D_Molecules_Automation
I have written scripts to automate the ligand, receptor preparation, generating isomers, converting those ismoer to 3d molecules and grid coordinate approximation in multiple scripts

Features
Stereoisomer Generation: Automatically generate stereoisomers of input molecules to explore different conformations.

3D Molecule Conversion: Convert 2D molecular structures to 3D structures for accurate docking simulations.

Image Generation: Create visual representations of molecular structures for analysis and visualization.

Ligand and Receptor Preparation: Automate the preparation of ligand and receptor structures, including format conversion and optimization.

Grid Coordinate Approximation: Generate grid coordinates for docking simulations, making it easy to set up AutoDock Vina configuration files.

Config File Generator: Automatically generate configuration files for AutoDock Vina with predefined or user-defined parameters.
